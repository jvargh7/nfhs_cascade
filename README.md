## Background
Previous studies from India reported on diabetes diagnoses (53%) and treatment (41%)  among adults 15-49 years. We used recent nationally-representative data from adults aged 18 years and older to estimate prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and the heterogeneity in diagnosis, treatment, and control by natal sex, age, and urbanicity.    
## Methods
We analyzed data from non-pregnant women (n = 867,896) and men (n = 783,280) in the National Family Health Survey-V (2019-21) of India. Based on self-reported diabetes status and random capillary blood glucose, we estimated sex-specific prevalence of diabetes (≥126mg/dL [fasting for 12 hours] or ≥200mg/dL [not fasting]). Among adults with diabetes, we used self-reported receipt of screening, diagnosis, and taking medication; we defined control by blood glucose <126 [fasting] / <200 mg/dL [not fasting]). We incorporated the complex survey design and stratified by socio-demographic characteristics (residence, sex, age category, wealth quintile). We developed a dashboard to assess care disparities at state- and district-levels.   
## Results
Nationally, the prevalence of diabetes was 6.5% (95%CI: 6.4, 6.6), with higher age-standardized prevalence in urban areas (vs rural areas) among men (%; 10.7 [95%CI: 10.4, 11.0] vs 6.1[95%CI: 5.9, 6.2]) and women (9.5 [95%CI: 9.2, 9.8] vs 4.6 [95%CI: 4.4, 4.7]).  Screening was also higher in urban areas, among women and higher with age. Among those with diabetes, 70.1% [69.3, 71.0] reported being diagnosed, of whom 59.4% [58.1, 60.6], and 34.5% [33.5, 35.5] reported taking medication, and had controlled blood glucose, respectively. Diagnosis, treatment, and control were all higher in urban areas, women, and older age groups.    
## Conclusions 
There is a high unmet need in screening, diagnosis, treatment, and control of diabetes nationally, and this is most pronounced in rural adults.    

## Comparison with NNMS 2017-18
The prevalence of diagnosed population in total population is 4.3% (9.3% $\times$ 45.8%) in NNMS and 4.3% (5.9% $\times$ 72.3%) in NFHS-5 for the same study population.

## Comparison with LASI 2017-18
The prevalence of diagnosed population in total population is 11.9% (19.7% $\times$ 60.4%) in LASI and 9.1% (12.1% $\times$ 75.5%) in NFHS-5 for the same study population.
